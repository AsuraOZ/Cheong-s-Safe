# Cheong's Introduction

Welcome to Cheong's GitHub Repository where you can see former chef transforming into an Programmer.
Before I started study on Software Engineering in Centennial College, I was a chef for little over a 10 years.
I have worked in a hotel, golf-club, cathering, and restaurant. My career started as a dishwasher and later on jumped to the line cook.
I really liked cooking and serve delicious meal to customers, family and friends.
